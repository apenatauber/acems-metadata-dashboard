  Welcome to the ACEMS Metadata HQ. Use this app to explore ACEMS
  call data from Fall 2016 to Spring 2022. Two visualization options
  are available:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Map view:</strong>
    An interactive map of Amherst College campus
    comparing call amounts at different locations. Data can be filtered by
    academic year, semester, call category, and chief complaint, and both total
    call counts and percentages can be shown. Percentages are taken as</br>
    <center><code>calls in selected category and chief complaint</code>
    </br>divided by</br>
    <code>total calls in selected academic year and semester,
    in that location</code>.</center></br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Bar chart:</strong>
    Horizontal bar chart visualizing call amounts
    from month to month and semester to semester. Data can be colored by nature of
    call, category, shift type, weekend/weekday, and result; and it can be
    filtered by academic year, month, and semester. The bar chart is interactive:
    items in the legend can be clicked on to remove them from the display and
    double-clicked on to remove all other elements.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  No patient-identifying information is available in this web app. Data is taken
  from the ACEMS metadata spreadsheet, which collects responses manually from
  a Google form filled out by the responding team.
